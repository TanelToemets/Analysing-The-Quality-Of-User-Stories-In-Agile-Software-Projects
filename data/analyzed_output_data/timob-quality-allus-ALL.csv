24409,"As a developer, I want to be able to pass arbitrary arguments to the Android emulator This is a blocker issue for TISTUD 623. When a run debug configuration is created, we need the ability to pass additional command line arguments to the android emulator.

For example, I am using the Motorola MD860 skin for the Atrix 4G whose screen is 960 pixels high. The resulting emulator window is some 1200 pixels high but my screen is only 900 pixels high. If you run the AVD from the AVD Manager, it offers the option to run with a particular screen size which uses the scale argument. We need the capability to do this in Studio. I would recommend simply adding an extensible option to specify any additional command line arguments.
