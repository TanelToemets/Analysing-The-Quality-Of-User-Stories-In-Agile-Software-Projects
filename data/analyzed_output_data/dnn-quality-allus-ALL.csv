23860,"Support multiple SqlDataProvider scripts for each release Support multiple SqlDataProvider scripts for each release Support multiple SqlDataProvider scripts for each release Support multiple SqlDataProvider scripts for each release DNN upgrades are based on a 3 part version number representing the platform, major and minor version numbers. Each version component uses a 2 digit integer with a leading zero for padding e.g. 01.02.03 . This version number uniquely identifies a release and is used as an identifier when creating database upgrade scripts. Every release may be composed of numerous builds, any one of which might include database changes. All database changes are included in a single script for any given version. This approach to versioning results in difficulty supporting upgrades from Betas to RCs to final release. Also, this script versioning scheme often results in merge conflicts as numerous developers need to edit a common script file. These merge conflicts complicate accepting community pull requests and in rolling back changes when necessary.

",NULL,"Edit a Data Type Edit a Data Type Edit a Data Type Edit a Data Type As an administrator, I want to be able to edit a Data Type. A Data Type will consist of a Type Name, a base type and boolean indicator whether the type is a system type. The editor for the Data Types should be displayed just below the data type in the list. Only Host users should be able to set the system type switch. Once a type is marked as a system type global it cannot be reverted back to a non system type not global . When the delete button is clicked, it will delete the type from the system, hide the editor and then update the data type list. When the save button is clicked, the record is saved, the editor is hidden and the list is updated to display the new Data Type. When the cancel button is clicked, the data is discarded and the editor is hidden. ",NULL,"Add for who this story is","well_formed","no_role","high",False
