When a run debug configuration is created, we need the ability to pass additional command line arguments to the android emulator. Specifically, the scale argument in order to use skins whose full scale causes them to be larger than the screen you are running on. For example, I am using the Motorola MD860 skin for the Atrix 4G whose screen is 960 pixels high. The resulting emulator window is some 1200 pixels high but my screen is only 900 pixels high. If you run the AVD from the AVD Manager, it offers the option to run with a particular screen size which uses the scale argument. We need the capability to do this in Studio. I would recommend simply adding an extensible option to specify any additional command line arguments.

"BlackBerry Fix implement relative include require BlackBerry Fix implement relative include require Currently, include s method of doing relative files only works if all done in successive order. It does not work for windows with a url not implemented or if include is used in a function of a file in a subdir. Also, require does not have any method right now. My proposal is to store the filepath in each TiObject so it can be retrieved later when needed.
