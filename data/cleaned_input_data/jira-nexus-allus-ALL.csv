"Make StorageFacet blob methods transactional If you call or but then roll back the transaction, the changes occur anyways. This can lead to orient and the blob store getting out of sync. A simple pattern for handling this was built into some older CMA work where it was called BlobTx it just accumulated new and to be deleted blobs in separate lists, and when the transaction was rolled back or committed, the corresponding list of blobs all get soft deleted. This isn t bulletproof transactionality, but it s much better than the current approach which completely ignores transactions for blob operations, and will err on the side of stray blobs rather than over eagerly deleted blobs.",NEXUS-7970,
