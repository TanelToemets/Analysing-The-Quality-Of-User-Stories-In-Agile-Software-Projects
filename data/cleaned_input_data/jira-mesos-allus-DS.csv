"Tasks currently log their output i.e. stdout stderr to files the sandbox on an agent s disk. In some cases, the accumulation of these logs can completely fill up the agent s disk and thereby kill the task or machine. To prevent this, we should either implement a log rotation mechanism or capped size logging. This would be used by executors to control the amount of logs they keep. Master agent logs will not be affected. We will first scope out several possible approaches for log rotation capping in a design document see . Once an approach is chosen, this story will be broken down into some corresponding issues.",MESOS-3348,0,

"This is the first basic step in ensuring the basic functionality processing a POST call and returning if all goes well; if not authorized; and if the request is malformed.

"This is a component of the slave that informs the slave about the possible corrections that need to be performed e.g., shutdown container using recoverable resources . This needs to be integrated with the resource monitor. Need to figure out the metrics used for sending corrections e.g., scheduling latency, usage, informed by We also need to figure out the feedback loop between the QoS controller and the Resource Estimator. class QoSController public monitor ; correction ; ; ",MESOS-2651,0,
"Currently, the C library sends different messages to Master instead of a single Call message. To vet the new Call API it should send Call messages. Master should be updated to handle all types of Calls.",MESOS-2551,0,
The master exports a counter of tasks transitioned to TASK LOST. This loses fidelity of the source of the lost task. A first step in exposing the source of lost tasks might be to just differentiate between TASK LOST transitions initiated by the master vs the slave and maybe bad input from the scheduler .,MESOS-1830,0,
"There is some known kernel issue when we freeze the whole cgroup upon OOM. Mesos probably can just use PID namespace so that we will only need to kill the init of the pid namespace, instead of freezing all the processes and killing them one by one. But I am not quite sure if this would break the existing code.",MESOS-1765,0,
"We now have a message string inside TaskStatus that provides human readable information about TASK FAILED. It would be good to add some structure to the failure reasons, for framework schedulers to act on programmatically. E.g. enum TaskFailure EXECUTOR OOM; SLAVE LOST; etc.. ",MESOS-343,0,
