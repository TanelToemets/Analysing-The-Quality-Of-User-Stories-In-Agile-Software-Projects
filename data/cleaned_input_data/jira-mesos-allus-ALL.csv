"As a Developer I want a better way to run shell commands When reviewing the code in r 36425 noticed that there is a better abstraction that is possible to introduce for that will simplify the caller s life. Instead of having to handle all possible outcomes, we propose to refactor as follows Returns the output from running the specified command with the shell. Try std string shell const string command Actually handle the WIFEXITED, WIFSIGNALED here! where the returned string is . And some test driven development world , os shell echo hello world ; Alternatively, the caller can ask to have Try string outAndErr os shell myCmd foo 2 1 ; However, will be ignored by default We don t read standard error by default. EXPECT SOME EQ , os shell echo hello world 1 2 ; We don t even read stderr if something fails to return in Try error . Try string output os shell echo hello world 1 2 false ; hello world ; An analysis of existing usage shows that in almost all cases, the caller only cares ; in fact, the actual exit code is read only once, and even then, in a test case. We believe this will simplify the API to the caller, and will significantly reduce the length and complexity at the calling sites 6 LOC against the current 20 .",MESOS-3142,

"Add either log rotation or capped size logging for tasks Tasks currently log their output i.e. stdout stderr to files the sandbox on an agent s disk. In some cases, the accumulation of these logs can completely fill up the agent s disk and thereby kill the task or machine. To prevent this, we should either implement a log rotation mechanism or capped size logging. This would be used by executors to control the amount of logs they keep. Master agent logs will not be affected. We will first scope out several possible approaches for log rotation capping in a design document see . Once an approach is chosen, this story will be broken down into some corresponding issues.",MESOS-3348,
"Expose TASK FAILED reason to Frameworks. We now have a message string inside TaskStatus that provides human readable information about TASK FAILED.
