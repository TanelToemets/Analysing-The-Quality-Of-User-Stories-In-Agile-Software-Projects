Kota made great strides in eliminating a large source of memory hogging going on storing all constant property values in fields of the enclosing type. We d not only store them for the class definition but also for every instance! Now that we store them in an unordered map and generate them on demand they re only cached once per class. But it d be a good improvement to move to something like an LRU cache to evict older constants out of the in memory cache if we ever need to free some memory. It d be good to have more details on just how much memory these are taking up and what the speed perf overhead of always generating them on demand would be or if that d even be feasible whether the constants would be considered equal when regenerated .,TIMOB-20316,

"I accidentally updated my ANDROID SDK environment variable to a bad value, and suddenly Studio was unable to find my Android platforms, even though I had a correct SDK specified in preferences. Digging into the code, I see that we pass a specific directory to search to avd.py, by androidsdk.py find sdk defers to ANDROID SDK before utilizing supplied . It seems we should respect the passed in directory first before defaulting to backup options like environment variables.",TIMOB-8658,
"iOS currently has some coding standards https wiki.appcelerator.org display pe Coding Standards available, with an uncrustify to beautify source in tidevtools https github.com billdawson tidevtools . We need to evaluate the uncrustify and manually written instructions for Correctness Completeness Consistency Tabs vs. spaces we need to standardize on one! These standards should apply to Objective C and Objective C only, but may require some preliminary drafts for C and C style. This ticket is not for establishing design patterns or workflow unlike the broad scope of TIMOB 8241, which is being narrowed. Part of this ticket is also deciding how to enforce code formatting i.e. coerce all submitters to make their source conform to the standard .",TIMOB-8627,

We should upgrade to a newer version of V8. One of the main new features that has been implemented is incremental GC. This also exposes some additional API that can help us better tune the GC. Targeting V8 version 3.9.24 3.9 stable branch .,TIMOB-8306,

"Based on ticket TISTUD 1180, it seems odd that Titanium Studio knows how to clean a build, especially since it doesn t know how to do the build itself. From here https wiki.appcelerator.org display guides Titanium Command Line Interface, it seems that a titanium clean platform p1,p2 command or if omitted, cleans all platforms would be good, as then Studio does not need to internalize a very platform specific function.",TIMOB-7652,
"Titanium Mobile is still reporting the SDK version as 1.9. Studio is now restricting UI elements for ACS based on an anticipated version of 2.0. Until the SDK version is updated, the UI elements will not appear.",TIMOB-7645,
"This is a blocker issue for TISTUD 623. When a run debug configuration is created, we need the ability to pass additional command line arguments to the android emulator. Specifically, the scale argument in order to use skins whose full scale causes them to be larger than the screen you are running on. For example, I am using the Motorola MD860 skin for the Atrix 4G whose screen is 960 pixels high. The resulting emulator window is some 1200 pixels high but my screen is only 900 pixels high. If you run the AVD from the AVD Manager, it offers the option to run with a particular screen size which uses the scale argument. We need the capability to do this in Studio. I would recommend simply adding an extensible option to specify any additional command line arguments. The standard Eclipse launch configurator allows this on the configuration s Target tab but that appears to be disabled in Studio. I believe we are not allowed to pass arbitrary arguments to the emulator. I could not find a duplicate issue, but if one exists, please mark this as such.",TIMOB-7393,
