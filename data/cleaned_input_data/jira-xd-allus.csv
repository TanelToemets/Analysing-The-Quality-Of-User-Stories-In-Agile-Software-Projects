Being able to listen to a stream at any point has a significant performance impact.

This serialized transported deserialized processes happens for each step in a flow source process sink.

"We should we centrally standardize on date time formats so that we don t create inconsistencies, and follow ISO 8601 internally. Internally we should only work with UTC or make that the default config option . Ultimately, whatever the user sees is just a formatting concern.",XD-1120,
We need to create a shell script that calls the batch DB creation sql files for the JDBC option selected. ,XD-1119,
We no longer validate the hadoopDistro options in the xd scripts. Seem sthe classes doing this validation were removed for boot. We do this validation in the xd shell script,XD-1115,
We have observed in unit tests see AbstractSingleNodeStreamIntegrationTests that Redis SingleNode occasionally fail. The root cause must be investigated further but there is some evidence to suggest that the control messages ModuleDeploymentRequests are not always received and handled by the ModuleDeployer. This does not produce an error but results in runtime stream failures. This problem may be resolved as part of the planned Deployment SPI but is being tracked here until we are certain that it has been resolved.,XD-1114,
"ApplicationContext ID generation is difficult in general. Cloud Foundry solves this problem for us by providing unique instance ids to all running instances of an app. I'don t suppose that helps much in the general case though, and we need something a rule of thumb that is unique and preferably deterministic, so that nodes retain their ID across process and connector restarts. In Cloud Foundry the instance id plays a vital role and will be automatically picked up by the app and applied need to look at how that plays in a context hierarchy . User can set the context id manually using spring.application.name and spring.application.index .",XD-1113,
"Spring Boot support port scanning if you set server.port 0 and disable with 1 , so we could make that the default for the container node.",XD-1112,
The following keys remain after running the test suite code redis 127.0.0.1 6379 keys 1 containers 2 containers.application 9292 code ,XD-1111,
"Currently, the JobRepoTests use the same batch job repository that the XD runtime uses. Since the batch job repo doesn t delete the job instances, there would be stale data from this test. ",XD-1110,
"Wherever they come from cmd line args or ENV VARS , options such as transport, analytics, etc should be validated and issues should be reported to users",XD-1109,
Restore foo bar as well as foo bar Validation of values should be done as a separate story,XD-1108,
"Currently, the tests use instantiated DistributedJobService object instead of a simple mock. We can just use mock object for the tests.",XD-1107,
"Even though it may be hard to come up with a mqtt broker, an easy test that should be automated is somesource mqtt topic foo with mqtt topics foo somesink And asserting that what is emitted to somesource ends up in somesink. ",XD-1105,
"Would be nice to have some kind of regression testing on the jdbc sink, as it becomes more prominent in XD. Use of an in memory db where we expose eg a JdbcTemplate to assert state",XD-1104,
would be good to have a general feel for the general performance of these two options. Redis can run on the same node as the benchmark.,XD-1102,
The way we now include various Hadoop distributions is cumbersome to maintain. Need a better way of managing and isolating these dependencies on a module level rather than container level.,XD-1097,
"Currently, the BatchJobsController and BatchJobExecutionsController are not HATEOAS compliant and we need make them so.",XD-1096,
"The automatic deployment of the job makes it harder to understand the lifecycle of the job and also does not allow for the opportunity to define any additional deployment metadata for how that job runs, e.g is it partitioned etc.",XD-1080,
BatchJobsController.listForJob should be executionsForJob BatchJobsController.jobInstances should be instancesForJob The JavaDoc for the class and each method should be more descriptive about their functionality ,XD-1079,
Develop out a Proof of concept for review that allows users to easily create a new module to Spring XD. Key features to be enabled 1. Allow existing modules to be included as a classpath dependency 2. Consolidate shared libraries in existing modules e.g. a shared lib for all gemfire modules 3. User develops a module as a normal Java project 4. User s project can then be added to a runtime container in the same way as a dependency Nice to have 1. at development time container can run continuously and pick up changes from user s module project. 2. Java config for a module. 3. command line functionality to create project scaffolding. ,XD-1077,
This is along the lines of what is in this blog post http coreyreil.wordpress.com 2012 12 21 spring batch creating an ftp tasklet to get remote files Note that there have been some new developments in SI to get at the underlying stream for FTP. The way to test this is to create a new batch job in XD that has this as it s tasklet. Going forward the target file system will also be HDFS.,XD-1076,
Migrating to boot dropped the XD banner and its info. Can be restored using eg a boot Initializer and removing the default boot banner,XD-1075,

"Use of dot in property name prevents the user from specifying a value in stream definition Also, defaults are repeated at .xml and .properties level",XD-1063,
Looks like we need to spend a cycle on Asciidoc as we still have the author tag issue I thought we can simply upgrade the asciidoctor gradle plugin to 0.7.0 currently 0.4.1 but that breaks the docs being generated.,XD-1061,
"apologies if a ticket already exists for this, but I'didn t see one I spun up the Hortonworks Data Platform 2.0 sandbox, but see it isn t supported by Spring XD yet. How hard would it be to add these Distro s in? Is it just a matter of dropping in a lib folder for hadoop22 and or hdp20, and allowing those and options to be passed in via the hadoopDistro option? I m currently trying to work through the following tutorial, but using the HDP 2.0 sandbox instead of the 1.3 sandbox http hortonworks.com hadoop tutorial using spring xd to stream tweets to hadoop for sentiment analysis Thanks!",XD-1060,
"Currently, the bootstrap.less file has all the styles that the bootstrap supports. But we should only add compile the LESS that are needed by XD UI.",XD-1058,
The table background color on the Job Definition Tab is green while the others tabs have a white background. They should be consistent.,XD-1057,
Job gets a empty key value pair when launching the job from the admin ui.,XD-1056,
"I know that the feature is not ready, but we either should post a message to the user that the feature is not available or hide the button",XD-1055,
The deployment tab does not reflect the current state of the jobs. User must hit browser refresh button to make it work.,XD-1054,
"e.g. see comment on PR 390 https github.com spring projects spring xd pull 390 files r7563787 In that case, it s delete in one place and destroy in another. There are other cases as well.",XD-1052,
"note from PR 365 quote We should probably create a new story to at least rename module display to module showconfig or something, but possibly even reconsider it altogether. In some sense, it s even violating the encapsulation of ModuleRegistry. It wont work for java config style modules or spring integration Groovy DSL modules. Personally, if anything, I'd rather see those config files themselves exposed as part of an admin UI. What you are doing with the options here fits better with the encapsulation principle and the fact that typical usage should not require detailed knowledge of the actual underlying configuration of a Module. quote ",XD-1051,
"note from PR 365 which has been merged providing the initial level of support... Pending issues to be addressed in another PR? x complex case x default values for complex case, when option is not surfaced back to the module eg suffix in our canonical example plugin provided options and values descriptive defaults instead of actual defaults e.g. use stream name JSR303 Validation ",XD-1050,
"this would elminate dependencies that are currently in the codebase, such as RESTModuleType and ModuleType enums ModuleOption and DetailedModuleDefinitionResource.Option ",XD-1045,
see comments on this PR which is part of the code that needs to be refactored https github.com spring projects spring xd pull 390 ,XD-1044,
"Currently the parser returns a List ModuleDeploymentRequest , and the deployer works with that list directly. We need a higher level parser result e.g. DeployableStream or probably a better name after some thought that can encapsulate that list while also enabling metadata to be added. That metadata may be helpful for composite module information as well as the module dependencies of a given stream including any composed modules within that stream .",XD-1043,
"The ModuleOptions PR currently uses FQN for types eg java.lang.String Would be nice to have support for short names for common types, both in the properties files and the annotation",XD-1042,
Make sure the sinks and jobs work against Pivotal HD 1.1,XD-1041,
See the discussion in https github.com spring projects spring xd pull 370 There are now various superseded classes and tests which we no longer need.,XD-1040,
"Provided it is not currently used in any stream V Attempt to destroy a composed module Should not be supported at all Should not be supported if involved in at least one stream EB?, MF! Should be supported and have no other consequences whatsoever see IV EB? Should be supported and invalidate destroy streams involving it ",XD-1036,
"As per discussion, any attempt to create something that would collide with existing should fail II Attempt to create a composed module with same name as an already existing, not composed module, with same type should fail EB, MF should work and shadow previous module from now on III Attempt to create a composed module with same name as an already existing composed module, with same type should fail EB, MF should work and shadow previous module from now on should work and retroactively change definitions of streams with that module ",XD-1035,
"This relates to XD 871 which provides a good scenario. stream create s1 definition http log deploy stream create s2 definition http log deploy The second command results in an error message that the port is in use but the stream definition is still saved. Since create deploy is a logical unit of work, it should follow transactional semantics. In other words if the deploy fails, the repository should be rolled back or a compensating destroy should be performed . Note this should not be handled the same way if create and deploy happen separately. In that case, the stream definition should remain.",XD-1034,
"Add a module that can act as a tcp client as opposed to our current tcp module, which acts as a server, waiting for an incoming connection Also, the module should allow to send commands to the remote server. The typical minimal case for such a protocol is to send PING messages, but a stateful mechanism should be put in place for more complex cases.",XD-1033,
"rename spring xd extension hdfs to something else, as it seems it is all spring data stuff and is not coupled to xd. But leave it in extensions for now rename and move spring xd hadoop inside extensions maybe to spring xd extension hadoop or hdfs make hadoop related modules depend on the latter which itself will depend on the former ",XD-1032,
"Use a modal dialog to specify runtime parameters. There should be a little text are that gives hints as to the spring batch parameter key value conventions, e.g. for type. Might be a good idea to have a checkbox that lets you select to auto increment job instance number. 4 columns key, value, type, identifying and an add parameter button that adds a new row. This would appear as a modal dialog box, polling of the state of the deployments would be suspended while the job parameter modal dialog box is shown. ",XD-1031,
Specify the default URL as code urlRoot location.protocol location.hostname location.port ? location.port code ,XD-1028,
The current admin UI uses bootstrap 3.0.0 which provides responsive design. We need to expand our scope to support all supported user agents. This requires changes to use user agent specific layout for the UI views.,XD-1026,
"From XD 1023, the job status deployed undeployed is available from JobInstance Repository and a job can be deployed undeployed correctly. Implement Job deploy undeploy for a given job from JobDefinitions page and indicate status of the job definition deployed undeployed .",XD-1025,
"The current XD uses an inadequate MessageRedisSerializer when extractPayload is false not currently being used . When porting this to SI, the serializer will be dropped. Suggest creation of Kryo serializer for Messages for when Redis source sinks are created.",XD-1024,
"Job deployment currently goes through an overloaded version of deploy that takes 4 parameters. This prohibits job handling code from benefiting from common behavior and eg currently breaks deployAll Given that the 3 additional parameters are in fine handled as module parameters, let s push them to the job definition, known at creation time, rather than at deployment time as it does not really make sense to change those between deploys ",XD-1023,
"The module list command currently has a very simplistic two column display of module name, module type . The is not very readable. Switch to a 4 column display Sources, Processors, Sinks, Jobs Additionally, mark composed module e.g. myhttp c ",XD-1022,
Create a composed module Create a stream that uses that module Try to undeploy the stream. Kaboom The dispatch is not correctly implemented in ModuleDeployer,XD-1021,
"ModuleDeployer has many methods with very similar names that are hard to understand. Moreover, there is a substantial amount of duplicated code that should be extracted in sub methods with descriptive names. One should even consider splitting the class ",XD-1020,
"Probably the cleanest approach is to provide a properties file in the xd config directory that enables this globally, e.g., json.pretty.print true. This will require some refactoring of the ModuleTypeConversion plugin, i.e., use DI in streams.xml",XD-1016,
"Create a reusable responsive UI layout to render the PagedResources returned from REST endpoint. As part of this, try upgrading the bootstrap to 3.0.0 and use the responsive styles offered in it.",XD-1015,
Currently HSQLDB is the only option for batch jobs. This should be configurable so that a user may select another JDBC data store option. Steps hsqldb.properties needs to be changed to batch jdbc.properties hsql prefixes should be changed to batch jdbc JDBC Connection String needs to be configurable JDBC Driver needs to be configurable The Setup Scripts to be used for spring batch need to be configurable.

Not sure where we want to set the semantic boundaries for the File Source. ,XD-874,
This story may need to be broken into several stories Particularly for Batch scenarios one may not want to run a file to string transformer on the payload file in the file source but rather handle pass the file reference itself local SAN etc. e.g. in case somebody drops a 2GB or in scenarios where one wants to push those large files into HDFS and run hadoop jobs on the data. This is important for Batch Jobs as they need to access the file itself for the reader. We need to keep in mind the various transports we support . Not sure how Kryo handles file serialization. I would think we only need the File Meta Data to be persisted not the file data itself make that configurable?? . ,XD-873,

Needs some investigation on how the update information from Spring Batch listeners can be sent as a message across modules in a single node configuration as well as across JVMs in a distributed node configuration.,XD-863,
"Similar to xpath with XML, there are now some initial support in SI that enable the use of filter routers based on JSON Path expressions. That support needs to be reviewed and then brought up to the level of exposure in Spring XD so that router filter modules could use JSON Path. json path filter router are components that need to be created, perhaps others. This story needs to be broken down further.",XD-862,
This story will need to be broken down further. The current code mixes together the type conversion that happens within a single JVM for data that is passed on a local transport between modules and serialization deserialization between JVMs. This should be separated. There was a suggestion that we could perhaps use typed data channels in SI as a means implement the type conversion between modules. The media type conversion support in Spring 4 is another part of this solution.,XD-861,

The syntax for both taps and job channels will be prefixed with the word tap. The parser will search both the all stream and job for now registries to find the name . If the name is present in only in one registry then that definition will be used. If the name is present both registries a syntax exception will be issued. The user then can optionally specify which registry to use by adding a second token to the definition that specifies the type of channel the user wants. i.e. tap stream streamName mySink If the user attempts to place a job on the greater left hand side without specifying a notification a syntax error will be thrown.

Most likely, this logic and the configuration methods for extending the converter map, belong in AbstractChannelRegistry since it should be common across all implementations i.e. the logic should be the same regardless of the transport used after serialization before deserialization .",XD-162,

This will allow for a simple way to shutdown the server via an HTTP call. Support for security is a separate story. The end goal is to have some shell scripts distributed that can issue HTTP requests to shutdown the xd admin and xd container servers. The newest version of Jolokia has the ability to boostrap itself inside an application context vs. requiring a java agent. I suspect using the application context approach will provide us with more flexibility e.g. property replacement etc but not sure.,XD-158,
In both cases there are multiple application contexts that can be running in the process. The JMX Managed bean should call close on those application contexts. The more detailed lifecycle of cleanly shutting down components within those application contexts is another story.,XD-157,
