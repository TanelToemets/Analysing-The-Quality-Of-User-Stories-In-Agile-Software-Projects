Create Custom Module Action HTML tokens Create Custom Module Action HTML tokens HTML does not have a mechanism for easily executing server side logic. As part of the SPA module support HTML modules will include support for using DNN tokens. The use of tokens provides the ability to link standard HTML to server side logic. HTML views need to be able to define the Module Action menu items associated with a specific view. The tokens for Module Action menus should mirror the capabilities and functionality provided by the Attributes created for MVC modules to perform this same functionality. These tokens will use a new token pattern Token Type 1 These tokens will call the standard DnnJSInclude methods with the defined parameters. The propertybag is a standard JSON object and includes parameter names and values which are used to call the appropriate include methods. The order of properties in the propertybag is unimportant and should not impact the ability to bind to the appropriate JSInclude methods. Token Type 2 This token variation will load predefined JavaScript packages which have been installed as JavaScript extensions.

"Support multiple SqlDataProvider scripts for each release Support multiple SqlDataProvider scripts for each release Support multiple SqlDataProvider scripts for each release Support multiple SqlDataProvider scripts for each release DNN upgrades are based on a 3 part version number representing the platform, major and minor version numbers.

This version number uniquely identifies a release and is used as an identifier when creating database upgrade scripts. Every release may be composed of numerous builds, any one of which might include database changes. All database changes are included in a single script for any given version. This approach to versioning results in difficulty supporting upgrades from Betas to RCs to final release. Also, this script versioning scheme often results in merge conflicts as numerous developers need to edit a common script file. These merge conflicts complicate accepting community pull requests and in rolling back changes when necessary.
