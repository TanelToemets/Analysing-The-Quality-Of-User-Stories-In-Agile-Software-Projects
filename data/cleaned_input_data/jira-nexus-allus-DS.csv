"Acceptance criteria There is a service to generate hashes for assets in one or more standard algorithms There s a standard spot in asset metadata for storing these hashes Wire it up so that Raw and Simple assets record these actual hashes as opposed to format specific ways of obtaining the expected hashes, which should also eventually be stored ",NEXUS-8046,0,

"Implement a repository which proxies a remote HTTP site and stores any files of any format in the CMA repository storage facet. Only GET requests are honored others are rejected .

This will serve as a reference implementation for more complex formats proxy repositories.",NEXUS-7844,0,
"Implement a simple bucket of files that allows for any file to be shared, so that they appear to be a repository while preserving the path. This is the simplest of the repo formats in Nexus. Equivalant of Site Repository from Nexus 2. We did this because Maven uploaded files such as HTML to describe your repo. This allows for to be shared. ",NEXUS-7843,0,

Staging has already been moved to orient db but old modello based config classes are still in place and used to upgrade from staging.xml.

PGP configuration has already been moved to a capability but old modello based config classes are still in place and used to upgrade from pgp.xml.

"View config includes a content storage policy the view either to uses the default blob store, or one which writes to a location specified in the view config. Well, really it s a sort of inline blob store config. ",NEXUS-7618,0,
Acceptance Criteria Add and test support for the ability to use the npm deprecate command to deprecate a package Add and test support for the ability to use the npm deprecate command to UNdeprecate a package Visually show that the package has been deprecated in Search and Browse This is the alternative for npm unpublish NEXUS 6892 ,NEXUS-7615,0,

"Component sources need configurable HTTP connection parameters, including thread connection pool sizes authentication credentials policy schema downgrade policy Expose a standard way of configuring HTTP connection parameters for connection sources presumably written into Map , and a framework for instantiating those pools and serving connections to HTTP based component sources.

We are currently unofficially supporting Java 8 we would like to officially support it. The only way to do that is run all Nexus tests using CI Java 8 on release branches. This task is about setting this up permanently. In addition any further work required to officially support Java 8 should be done.,NEXUS-7330,0,
