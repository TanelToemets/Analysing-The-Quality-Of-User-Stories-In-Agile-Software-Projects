"SPA Modules should behave the same as any other DNN module when it comes to packaging. A SPA module should be installable using a standard DNN module manifest.

The DNN framework should use the defined html file to render the requested module control following the standard DNN convention.

Currently DNN modules use an IActionable interface to define custom module actions which are rendered in the Module Action Menu. The purpose of the interface is to define a well known method that can be called by the framework to retrieve a collection of actions defined by the module developer. Each controller action may be used to render a view and thus should be able to define a collection of actions which the framework can retrieve and render. ,DNN-6643,

It appears that older APIs like nbsp;SearchDataStoreController.GetSearchResults nbsp;and few others in same class are not brought forward to use new Search API. We need to work with PM to first find out if this is needed or not. Ash is writing this story so we don apos;t forget.,DNN-3134,
"We apos;d like to write a Crawler that can Index User Profile so search can be done very quickly using Lucene, especially for Profile Properties which are hard to search for from performance point of view 1 Crawler should respect public private admin only security settings on profile property 2 Crawler should be able to re index when any of the property is changed 3 Crawler should be able to delete from the index when user is deleted both soft or hard nbsp; Note This was not part of initial requirement, however PM has shown interest in this area. I am marking it as low priority for now.",DNN-3133,

"Per Social PM, the Toast API needs to be moved into platform. Currently, Social team has added a new column names SendToast to core table in Social 1.0. Ideally this should have been done at the beginning, but at that time we were past the deadline for core cut off. This must be done in the next maint release.",DNN-3116,
