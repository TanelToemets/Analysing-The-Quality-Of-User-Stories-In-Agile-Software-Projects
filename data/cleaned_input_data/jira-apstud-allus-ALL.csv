Create stand alone project so JSParser can be run from the command line outside of Eclipse Our current implementation of our JS parsing infrastructure does not allow the parser to be run outside of Eclipse. We need to extract the minimal set of classes that will de couple our implementation from Eclipse and allow the parser to be run from the command line. This code and any scaffolding should live in a separate repository.,APSTUD-4722,
Publish Studio Javadocs as part of nightly builds We are now generating Javadocs for the Studio and Titanium core plugins as part of our continuous release builds. We should publish the latest versions out for nightlies. The docs live in the folders of the and builds.,APSTUD-4786,
Document Jflex scanner architecture Discuss the general structure of the jflex files we have. I think someone familiar with regular expressions could pick up jflex really quickly and this could be a good head start for them Briefly describe the process of generating a scanner from a jflex file. This is how you run it from the command line or within Eclipse to generate the associated Java file. Discuss how jflex scanners are modified to work with Beaver,APSTUD-4787,
Document Beaver parser architecture Discuss the general structure of the Beaver files we have. Briefly describe the process of generating a parser from a Beaver grammar. This is how you run it from the command line or within Eclipse to generate the associated files. ,APSTUD-4788,
"Document additional facets of the scripting architecture We may have documentation on this already, but the most complicated area in the current implementation revolves around visibility events. These events are driven by changes in visibility of commands and such based on bundle precedence rules. We may want to consider removing all notions of augmentation, which would simplify this area a bit Discuss how inputs and outputs should be pulled out into extensions to Improve code Allow other input output types to be contributed Discuss a possible way to fix bundle loading issues we ve seen on Windows. We need to be able to lock the loading of a bundle until its bundle.rb has been processed. This sounds easy, but I think it will have a big impact on the code, unfortunately",APSTUD-4789,
"Document the JSCA processing architecture We had tried to come up with a system for JSCA that was comparable to how our XML metadata works SAX like parsing and event driven handlers. However, the result is much too complicated and harder to maintain than it should be. It s worth documenting how the handler works at a minimum. Additionally, it might be good to discuss an alternate approach, that, although tied directly to the JSCA structure, is easier to maintain and update.",APSTUD-4790,
"Document the JavaScript inferencing architecture Discuss the classes involved and their roles Discuss the hacks put in place to get around issues exposed by jquery style functions Discuss possibilities for reducing indexing time particularly not doing any reads during writes Discuss why the Function wrapper is bad and how it might be removed. This relates to the hacks mentioned above Discuss the differences in handling of sdocml files during metadata loading versus during indexing. Ideally, these should be treated in the same way.",APSTUD-4791,
"Document the content assist architecture Briefly discuss the notion of location type and how that is calculated in HTML, CSS, and JS Briefly discuss the notion of replacement range and how that is calculated in HTML, CSS, and JS Briefly discuss how JS and CSS CA are hacked into HTML",APSTUD-4792,
Document how we do JavaScript parsing Discuss the recovery strategy interface used by JSParser. Note that these types of recoveries have been exposed in such a way as to make them available to all languages that use Beaver Show examples of how discovery strategies are defined Discuss rules based on the last good token Discuss rules based on the current failed token Suggest how the parser can stand alone and be integrated into the IDE. The current stand alone version of JSParser was a quick and dirty extraction from Eclipse purely to allow Bryan to start working with it to see if it will work for his needs.,APSTUD-4793,
"Document current and proposed approaches in the JavaScript Outline View We have talked about having different outlines for JS. It may be that the current outline and the JS node in the Index View will cover this topic already, but it s probably worth capturing thoughts here to see how those fit with what we have already.",APSTUD-4794,
"Document project build path architecture We may want to discuss how items in project build paths should be handled Ideally, each library is indexed only once regardless of how many projects reference it Metadata should be handled with the same system This may allow metadata files to auto update on changes instead of relying on the JS index version number we maintain manually right now Then again, changes to the structure of the index content will still require a version number change",APSTUD-4795,
Remove deprecated references to We replaced the individual logError calls in plugins with calls to IdeLog.logError . Some of the deprecated original calls still remain in the ScriptingActivator plugin.,APSTUD-4850,

"Test latest CEF version on Linux Before adopting a newer version of CEF, we need to test whether it will fix the current issues. This can be done independent of Studio. The following steps should be used Pull CEF Chromium code Run to create the project Run make j4 cefclient BUILDTYPE Release to build the project Launch the generated executable",APSTUD-7297,

Currently, we need the following for the extension point Listener for project creation Scoped to project nature Prioritized so that multiple listeners will be performed in proper order",APSTUD-7320,
"Split JS plugin into core and UI parts We may need to move some NodeJS functionality from Titanium Studio down into Aptana Studio. We built that functionality properly separated into core and UI plugins, and joining them back may cause issues as well as actually breaks proper architecture. As a result, we should split the JS plugin into core and UI properly so we can eventually merge the node stuff down in.",APSTUD-7572,
Split CSS Editor plugin into core and UI plugins We ve combined core and UI code in the CSS editor plugin. For proper separation we should split the two apart as we did with the JS plugin.,APSTUD-7575,

"PHP Debugger This is something that was shipped with 1.5 skipped out on 2.0 so don t know if it s there . Don t know if this is planned for 3.0 on the product page I ve seen that JS debugging is coming soon , yet it would be great if this were to be found into Aptana again same goes for the ability to run a script through the PHP parser to get the output . I ve found the debugger to be one of the main Aptana features I use during my lectures I m a lecturer at a technical university , helping the students to understand what s going on on the inside of a PHP process.",APSTUD-769,
