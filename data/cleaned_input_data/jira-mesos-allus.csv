Create a document that describes the problems with having only single role frameworks and proposes an MVP solution and implementation approach.,MESOS-4284,
"Tasks currently log their output i.e. stdout stderr to files the sandbox on an agent s disk. In some cases, the accumulation of these logs can completely fill up the agent s disk and thereby kill the task or machine. To prevent this, we should either implement a log rotation mechanism or capped size logging. This would be used by executors to control the amount of logs they keep. Master agent logs will not be affected. We will first scope out several possible approaches for log rotation capping in a design document see MESOS 3356 . Once an approach is chosen, this story will be broken down into some corresponding issues.",MESOS-3348,
"With the new JSON MasterInfo published to ZK, we want to provide a simple library class for Java Framework developers to retrieve info about the masters and the leader.",MESOS-3212,
"With the new JSON MasterInfo published to ZK, we want to provide a simple library class for Python developers to retrieve info about the masters and the leader.",MESOS-3211,
"Following from MESOS 2902 we want to enable the same functionality in the Mesos Agents too. This is probably best done once we implement the new os shell semantics, as described in MESOS 3142.",MESOS-3154,
"Following from MESOS 2340, which now allows Master to correctly decode JSON information MasterInfo published to Zookeeper, we can now enable the Master Leader Contender to serialize it too in JSON.",MESOS-3135,
"This is a simple test story to try out the new workflow. Unfortunately, testing and getting it to work seems to be something that actually does take up time, so I m tracking this here.",MESOS-2939,
"This is the first basic step in ensuring the basic call functionality processing a noformat POST call noformat and returning 202 if all goes well; 401 if not authorized; and 403 if the request is malformed. We ll get more sophisticated as the work progressed eg, supporting 415 if the content type is not of the right kind .",MESOS-2860,
"The information exposed by the Framework via the WebUIUrl does not always resolves to a routable endpoint eg, when the hostname is not publicly resolvable, or resolvable at all . In order to facilitate service discovery via, eg, Marathon UI we want to add the information in FrameworksPid via the state summary endpoint.",MESOS-2746,
"This is a component of the slave that informs the slave about the possible corrections that need to be performed e.g., shutdown container using recoverable resources . This needs to be integrated with the resource monitor. Need to figure out the metrics used for sending corrections e.g., scheduling latency, usage, informed by executor scheduler We also need to figure out the feedback loop between the QoS controller and the Resource Estimator. code class QoSController public QoSController ResourceMonitor monitor ; process Queue QoSCorrection correction ; ; code ",MESOS-2651,
"Currently, the C library sends different messages to Master instead of a single Call message. To vet the new Call API it should send Call messages. Master should be updated to handle all types of Calls.",MESOS-2551,
The master exports a monotonically increasing counter of tasks transitioned to TASK LOST. This loses fidelity of the source of the lost task. A first step in exposing the source of lost tasks might be to just differentiate between TASK LOST transitions initiated by the master vs the slave and maybe bad input from the scheduler .,MESOS-1830,
"There is some known kernel issue when we freeze the whole cgroup upon OOM. Mesos probably can just use PID namespace so that we will only need to kill the init of the pid namespace, instead of freezing all the processes and killing them one by one. But I am not quite sure if this would break the existing code.",MESOS-1765,
"We now have a message string inside TaskStatus that provides human readable information about TASK FAILED. It would be good to add some structure to the failure reasons, for framework schedulers to act on programmatically. E.g. enum TaskFailure EXECUTOR OOM; EXECUTOR OUT OF DISK; EXECUTOR TERMINATED; SLAVE LOST; etc.. ",MESOS-343,
