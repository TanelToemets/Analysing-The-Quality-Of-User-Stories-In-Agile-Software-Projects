Ideally in line with the MongoDB 4.0 release, or soon after, MongoDB Compass would do the same when connecting to MongoDB community e.g. it should prompt users to enable access to our free monitoring cloud after enabling it should show the user their dedicated monitoring URL The scope of this project has rapidly been solidifying over the last few weeks, hence filing this now.",COMPASS-2582,
