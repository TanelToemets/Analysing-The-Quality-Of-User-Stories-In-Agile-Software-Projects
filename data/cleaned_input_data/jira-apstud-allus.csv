"h3. Steps to Reproduce We just upgraded to Studio 3.1.3, and now we get a ton of JSLint errors in our code. Seems to be because of changes to default settings? We could put the settings into jslint comments to make it work how we want it to, but that would require adding the settings to the 300 JavaScript files that we have on our site. That is unacceptable. We need a place to be able to specify JSLint s settings on a global level. We use JSLint on reconcile mode, and seeing all of the errors for things like supposedly messy whitespace, using multiple var statements, etc makes the tool downright useless for the actual errors that we need it to catch. h3. Actual Result See above h3. Suggested solution Remove the filter box from the validator main page and have the pencil icon open up a new window similar to how formatting works . See screenshots. For JSLint and all validators , we would keep a filter text box, as well as have another text box where a user can specify whatever JSLint commands they d like to issue I m assuming this would be in the form of a string of options that would then be injected into the comments of a file before parsing.",APSTUD-4883,

Long term we may want to handle freeing the strings from the pool in a smarter way when the referring elements themselves are removed say a bundle gets removed but the effort required given that unusual unlikely use case may not warrant it. Secondly, we should use StringPool for a lot of the duplicated string values in PHP builtins.

"Currently, the File New From Template menu creates a new project based file or a new file on the filesystem, depending on the active selection in project explorer defaulting to the project based behavior Many users want the ability to create a new untitled file. This is possible, but a user would then have to preselect the type of file i.e. HTML, CSS, etc. . In order to achieve this in Studio 2, we had a selection of wizards that activated and deactivated based on the current selection. This worked, but was a clumsy solution. A different proposal is that we, by default, make the New From Template menu adopt the following behavior File New From Template. Creates a new untitled file of the specified type new behavior Right click on project in Project Explorer view. Creates a new project based file current behavior Right click on file system node in Project Explorer. Creates a new file on the file system current behavior This links with another ticket to make it easier to save this file into a project or file depending on the user s preference.",APSTUD-2816,

"When using Subclipse to merge some revisions, there s a view Merge Results where the merged files are listed.

In Aptana 3.x there s no menu entry to upload the files from that view You have to search each of the merged files or directories in the Project Explorer or App Explorer and upload it there. There should be the Deploy Menu Entry in the context menu of the Merge Results View. ",APSTUD-2798,

"Currently, when adding a remote, we default to git github.com username project.git, which is read only Suggest instead we default to git github.com username project.git, which is read write Alternately, we might ask the user if they are a contributor to the project, or just an observer, and perhaps offer a switch betwen the two optons",APSTUD-2771,
